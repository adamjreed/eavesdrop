# Eavesdrop

Eavesdrop is an application that listens to TuneGenie APIs (currently trained on Atlanta's 99x) and logs their plays for analytical purposes.

The application is based on a Laravel backend providing an API to an AngularJS frontend. Eventually a Spotify integration will exist to allow exporting play logs to Spotify playlists.
